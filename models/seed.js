    img: "https://gearjunkie.com/legacy/images/19992.jpg",
    description: "Colorado’s highest summit is a grandfatherly gentle giant, at least by Rocky Mountains standards. Elbert’s large, rounded dome is easily accessed by several trails, all of which begin in vanilla-scented pine forests and emerge from treeline with stunning views of the Sawatch Range. That’s not to say it’s a walk in the park — there’s a matter of 4,400 feet of elevation gain over 4.5 miles to deal with — but the paths are well maintained and easy to follow. Reach the top and you’ll be in the heart of the highest mountain range in the lower 48.",

    img: "https://gearjunkie.com/legacy/images/19988.jpg",
    description: "Among the most challenging 14ers, Capitol Peak is tough for the right reasons — solid rock, heart-in-your-throat exposure and tricky but fair route finding. It’s an 18-mile round trip, and that’s part of the joy. A long approach along Capitol Creek passes through gorgeous aspen forests and ends at Capitol Lake, where the real work begins. After navigating a steep pass, honest class 4 rock makes for a spectacular path to the summit, including the notorious knife edge traverse. Savvy climbers know the top is only the half-way point — the way down is just as fun and demanding as the ascent",

    img: "https://gearjunkie.com/legacy/images/19994.jpg",
    description: "San Luis Peak is located in a remote portion of the San Juan Mountains near the town of Gunnison, Colo., — smack dab in the middle of the Rocky Mountains. Isolation is part of its charm. A summer venture to San Luis follows several peaceful creeks past vibrant fields of wildflowers. Views are expansive and as the alpine grasses yield to the rocky terrain of the summit block, the trail remains intact and easy to navigate. The summit views are pristine, rolling and nearly absent of any man-made landmarks.",

    description: "Fred and Hertha Thomas owned two shops in Larimer Square (Cafe Promenade and Boutique Int’l). In 1969, they decided to honor their favorite tradition in front of the Cafe, and quietly tapped a keg and served some pretzels and white radishes. Until 2007, the event was held on the 14th block of Larimer St. and since it has been hosted at 20th and Larimer in historic Denver, Colorado. The Denver Oktoberfest attracts over 350,000 people during the six-day festival and it was quoted in Maxim Magazine and USA Today as “The Best Oktoberfest” in the United States and one of the country’s biggest and longest running traditions.  It’s also one of the largest beer festivals in the United States based on consumption because Denver drinks beer really well.",

The oldest ski hill in Colorado opened here in 1915, and since then, the newer and much larger Steamboat Ski Resort has opened with 2,965 ac of diverse ski terrain across an entire mountain range. The town is also home to geothermal hot springs where you can soak those weary muscles after a hard day on the slopes!",

    description: "Keystone treads the middle ground between luxury ski resorts like Vail and bustling ski towns like Breckenridge, offering an affordable and family-friendly ski experience while remaining competitive in other aspects. Night skiing is one of them, with the largest number of trails in the state lit up after dark here, which solidifies Keystone’s claim of having Colorado’s longest ski day! It also has a fantastic cat ski operation that costs just $10 a ride, opening up huge swathes of powder-filled glades and bowls to tear through.",

    description: "Arapahoe Basin, A-Basin, The Legend, however you want to call this ski resort, its reputation precedes itself. Shrugging off the idea that ski resorts need to offer a multitude of facilities and amenities, it instead focuses solely on riding the mountain. This draws a younger crowd that like to drink beers and rip through the steeps - giving the A-basin a very authentic local flavor. Thanks to its north facing slopes and high elevation, Arapahoe Basin enjoys one of the longest ski seasons in Colorado, opening in October and sometimes staying open until July!",

Beautiful mountain views of the Continental Divide and scenes of Estes Park and Longs Peak surround you as well as unique rock formations on this glacial moraine.

The trail makes for an easy day hike and has some of the most beautiful meadows with flowers dotting the path the entire way.",
