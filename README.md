I built a full stack application using Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS. This a website for people living in or visiting Colorado. In the homepage you can choose which season you are looking to participate in the activity. Initially there are only four different activities per season. If I had more time I would continuously add more activities. 

Deployed through heroku.

Sessions- Used to create a login page in which you create a name and a password. The password is encrypted so hackers cannot retrieve personal information.

Users- Used to login to your account if you created one. 

I used Node.js, Mongoose, Express, EJS, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and Google Maps API. Different routes bring you to the different parts of the website if action is committed. Controllers,  Models, Depencies, Index pages, Middleware, and seed routes all worked together to make the website functional. 

Future Upgrades- Create nested schemas so I donâ€™t have a different views page for each different season. I would a very large amount of activities for each season. More css features, including hover over options, drop down menu with more routes to go directly to different locations in the website.
